This repository contains programs in the `src` directory which illustrate the problem of soliciting input of numeric data using Java's `Scanner` class. Solutions to this problem are given.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain Java source code files (i.e. `.java` files)
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies (i.e. external libraries used in this project)

Compiled bytecode files (i.e. `.class` files) will be generated in a `bin` folder by default.
